        <h2>SignalJ Overview</h2>
        <p>SignalJ is a port of <a href="http://asp.net/signalr" target="_blank">ASP.Net SignalR</a> to PlayFramework and Akka. SignalJ provides an abstraction for client-server and server-client
        message based communication. The client is usually a browser. In that case, the communication mechanism is chosen automatically based on the browser's capabilities: Websockets, ServerSentEvents, and
        Ajax Longpolling. For older versions of IE, SignalR provides ForeverFrames but that features has not been ported to SignalJ yet. Other clients for SignalR exist as well, such as: iOS, Andriod, and
        .net framework. This allows the same server code to be easily used by both browsers and native clients. In this tutorial we will be dealing with javascript/browser clients.</p>
        <p>Another benefit of using SignalJ is that the communication is abstracted away from the developer. This allows for very easy and concise syntax both on the server and on the client. For example:
        to send execute client side code on all connected clients you would write this code on the server: </p>
        <pre><code>
clients().all.myClientFunction(someParam);
        </code></pre>
        <p>and in your javascript you would handle it:</p>
        <pre><code>
hub.client.userJoined = myClientFunction(param) {
    console.log("Param: " + param);
};
        </code></pre>
        <p>Lastly, SignalR (and therefore SignalJ) handles gracefully, client side connection problems. It can reconnect if disconnected. Handle slow connections, letting you handle an event to notify the
        user if you wish, and negotiate transports as mentioned above.</p>
        <p>Although, SignalJ is not a chat server, the example most used is building one, so in the next sections of the tutorial we will see how we can build a chat server with a login screen and rooms.</p>

        <h2>Server Side Setup</h2>
        <p>First, include the following lines in your <a href="#code/build.sbt">build.sbt</a>:</p>
        <pre><code>
resolvers += "release repository" at "http://chanan.github.io/maven-repo/releases/"

resolvers += "snapshot repository" at "http://chanan.github.io/maven-repo/snapshots/"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    javaJdbc,
    javaEbean,
    cache,
    javaWs,
    "signalJ" %% "signalj" % "0.5.0",
    "org.webjars" %% "webjars-play" % "2.3.0-2"
    "org.webjars" % "jquery" % "2.1.1"
)
        </code></pre>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> SignalJ is a JQuery plugin and requires JQuery to work. It can work with either JQuery 1.x to support older browsers, or with 2.x. This example shows including JQuery via
        Webjars, but you may include JQuery in your project via other means or by pointing to a CDN.</p>
        <p>SignalJ is a play plugin therefore it needs to be registered in <a href="#code/conf/play.plugins">conf/play.plugins</a>. Eitehr create or edit the file and add the line:</p>
        <pre><code>
10000:signalJ.SignalJPlugin
        </code></pre>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The number at the start of the line is the plugin load number. You can change that number if you have other plugins and want to load SignalJ before or after them.</p>
        <p>Next you will need to add the SignalJ routes to your <a href="#code/conf/routes">routes</a> files:</p>
        <pre><code>
->     /      signalJ.Routes
        </code></pre>
        <p>The next two step are <em>optional</em>. First, if you wish to use the ServerSentEvents or AJAX LongPolling transports you will need to extend your
        <a href="#code/app/Global.java">Global</a> from SignalJ's Global (<code>signalJ.SignalJGlobal</code>). (Note: in the event you cannot do so, there are other options. Please see the documentation at
        <a href="http://signalj.io" target="_blank">the SignalJ website</a>). If you plan to only support Websockets, this step is not needed.</p>
        <p>The second optional step is only required if want to load the SignalR's JQuery plugin (and therefore SignalJ's) from inside the the plugin itself. This options & benefits of different ways of loading
        the JQuery plugin are discussed in the next step of the tutorial (Client Side Setup). However, if you do chose to use this option then two changes need to be made. First, you will need to include sbt-web version 1.1
        or above in your <a href="#code/project/plugins.sbt">plugins.sbt</a>: </p>
        <pre><code>
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbt" % "sbt-web" % "1.1.1")
        </code></pre>
        <p></p>Second, you will need to add the following line to
        <a href="#code/build.sbt">build.sbt</a>:</p>
        <pre><code>
WebKeys.directWebModules in Assets += "signalj"
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Client Side Setup</h2>
        <p>Three script files are needed for SignalJ to work: JQuery, SignalR's JQuery plugin, and SignalJ's hubs javascript file.</p>
        <p>First, include JQuery in your project. Use JQuery 1.x if you plan to support older browsers. In this example, I included JQuery 2 via <a href="http://webjars.org" target="_blank">Webjars</a>.
        This can be found in <a href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html">/app/views/main.scala.html</a>: <code><pre>&lt;script type='text/javascript' src='@routes.WebJarAssets.at(WebJarAssets.locate("jquery.min.js"))'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></code>.
        </p>
        <p>Next you will need to include SignalR's JQuery plugin. There are 3 main options for this step:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can use a CDN to include either the un-minified version: <code><pre>&lt;script src="//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/signalr/jquery.signalr-2.1.0.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></code> or the minified version:
            <code><pre>&lt;script src="//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/signalr/jquery.signalr-2.1.0.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></code></li>
            <li>You can download the plugins from the links above and save them in your project and then added them to your page</li>
            <li>Or, you can link to the /signalj/jquery.signalR.js route inside of the SignalJ plugin. The benefit of this option is that it will use the un-minified version of the file in development mode and the
            minified version in production mode. The draw back of this is that changes to plugins.sbt and build.sbt must be made as specified in the "Server Side Setup" step of this tutorial outlined</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In this tutorial, I used option 3 as can be seen in <a href="#code/app/views/main.scala.html">/app/views/main.scala.html</a>: <code><pre>&lt;script src="/signalj/jquery.signalR.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></code>.</p>
        <p>Lastly, you must include the auto-generated hub script: <code><pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="/signalj/hubs.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></code></p>
        <p>After those 3 script files are included, you application specifc script files would be included, in this example:
        <code><pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="@routes.Assets.at("javascripts/chat.js")"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></code>.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Writing Your First Hub Class</h2>
        <p>Before looking in detail at the Chat server, lets learn some basics of using SignalJ</p>
        <p>The hub classes are the classes that the client can invoke on the server. A hub class can be in any package, in this case I place mine in the hubs package. A hub class extends
        <code>signalJ.services.Hub</code>. This class is a generic type that requires an interface as its parameter. The interface are the functions that should be present on the client and can be
        called from the server. In the Chat example you can see the client side functions declared in <a href="#code/app/hubs/ChatPage.java">/apps/hubs/ChatPage</a>:</p>
        <pre><code>
public interface ChatPage {
    public void userJoined(String username);
    public void sendMessage(String username, String message);
    public void userList(Set&lt;String&gt; users);
    public void userLeftRoom(String username);
    public void userJoinedRoom(String username);
    public void roomList(Set&lt;String&gt; rooms);
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>Two things to note about the interface above. One is that there is no server side class the implements this interface. This interface is only used to declare what functions (messages) the browser will handle.
        Second, complex objects may be passed to the client as well. They will be serialized to Json. In this case, we see two methods have <code>Set</code> parameters. They will be transferred as Json arrays.</p>
        <p>Now, we can create the hub class: <a href="#code/app/hubs/ChatHub.java">/apps/hubs/ChatHub.java</a>. Only one method must be overridden <code></code> as shown below:</p>
        <pre><code>
public class ChatHub extends Hub&lt;ChatPage&gt; {
    @Override
    protected Class&lt;ChatPage&gt; getInterface() {
        return ChatPage.class;
    }
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>As you see, you <em>must</em> return the interface class in this method.</p>
        <p>You are now ready to write server side functions that will be callable from the client.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Future versions of SignalJ may allow Actors to be hubs as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Hub Methods</h2>
        <p>Any public method can be called from a client. The methods are called asynchronously inside of an actor. Each time a hub method is invoked, a new instance of the hub is created. The hub class can
        be supplied by your dependency injection framework. For more information on this check out the documentation at the <a href="http://signalj.io" target="_blank">SignalJ website</a>.</p>
        <p>Hub methods can be void or return a value. For example, a method that adds two numbers can be written in two ways that differ in the way they are handled on the client (more on that topic
        in the client section):</p>
        <pre><code>
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>In this case the hub returns the the number directly to the caller (again, <strong>note</strong> the code does not block and is executed and returned via actor messages). To handle this call on the
        client, we can write the following javascript code:</p>
        <pre><code>
hub.server.add(1, 2).done(function(result) {
    console.log('1 + 2 = ' + result);
});
        </code></pre>
        <p>When SignalJ gets a response from the server, the promise will complete and the done function will be called with the result.</p>
        <p>The other way of writing similar code is by using a void method and calling a method on the client. While slightly more involved, this offers more flexibility as message could be sent to other clients
        as well. First add a method to your Hub's interface class such as <code>public void addResult(int result);</code>. Then define your hub method as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>
public void add(int a, int b) {
    clients().caller.addResult(a + b);
}
        </code></pre>
        <p>Now, we see the method is declared as void, and the <code>clients()</code> property of the hub was used with the <code>caller</code> (other options exist as we will see in later sections). The javascript
        to handle this case is slight different. This time, the result will be messaged to the client and will not return in a promise:</p>
        <pre><code>
hub.server.add(1, 2);

hub.client.addResult = function(result) {
    console.log('1 + 2 = ' + result);
}
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Hub Properties and Functions</h2>
        <p>Hub classes have several functions available to developers to use. We have seen some examples in the previous sections. Here is a more complete list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>clients().caller</code> - executes a function on the client that called the hub</li>
            <li><code>clients().all</code> - executes a function on all clients connected to the hub</code></li>
            <li><code>clients().others</code> - executes a function on all clients except the caller</li>
            <li><code>clients().client(connectionId)</code> - executes a function on a specific connection</li>
            <li><code>clients().AllExcept(connectionId1, connectionId2, ...)</code> - executes a function on all clients except those listed</li>
            <li><code>clients().Group(groupName)</code> - executes a function on a specific group of clients (See group management below</li>
            <li><code>clients().OthersInGroup(groupName)</code> - executes a function to all others in a group</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can added or remove users from a group by calling the <code>groups()</code> method. There is no need to create first or destroy a group when it is empty. That is done automatically.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>groups().add(connectionId, groupName);</code> - adds a specific connection to a group</li>
            <li><code>groups().remove(connectionId, groupName);</code> - removes a specific connection from a group</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On that note, lets see how we can get a client's connectionId:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>context().connectionId</code> - Retrieves the connectionId of the caller</li>
            <li><code>context().queryString</code> - Returns the request query string that was sent along with the connection</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also pass state from the client to the server and back using callerState:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>clients().callerState</code> - returns the caller state Map&lt;String, String&gt;</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Client Side - Connecting to a hub</h2>
        <p>To connect to a hub, you must first connect to a hub and then start the transport. For example:</p>
        <pre><code>
var hub = $.connection.chatHub;
$.connection.hub.start().done(function () {
    console.log('Connected to hub');
});
        </code></pre>
        <p>First, in the code above, you can see that you need to make a connection to a specific hub. The name <code>chatHub</code> is the name of the hub class
        you created previously <a href="#code/app/hubs/ChatHub.java">ChatHub</a>. Note the case was change to match Json conventions. You can also assign a name
        to a hub using the <code>HubName</code> annotation.</p>
        <p>Second, you start the hub. In this case, the hub is started in "auto transport" mode. That means it will first try to connect with Websockets, then
        ServerSentEvents and lastly AJAX Longpolling (A future version of SignalJ will also enable Forever Frames). You can also specify a specific transport
        in the start method, for example:</p>
        <pre><code>
$.connection.hub.start().done(function ({ transport: 'serverSentEvents' }){
    console.log('Connected using ServerSentEvents!');
});
        </code></pre>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> To use transports other than Websockets, you must enable them in your Global. Please see the section on "Server Side Setup".</p>
        <p>Lastly, a promise is reedemed when a connection is made. you can also install a <code>fail</code> function to catch the event of a connection not being able to be established.</p>
